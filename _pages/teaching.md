As a graduate student, I have served as teaching assistant to two courses in the School of Plant Sciences. These two courses varied in their focus, allowing me to develop my teaching and general communication skills for students in various academic disciplines.

## The University of Arizona
- Plant Science 429: Advanced Concepts in Cyberinfrastructure (Fall 2021)
  - Focus on scientific computing in plant science research. Topics included high performance computing, applications of machine learning, and collaboration across academic disciplines.
- Plant Science 170C2: Biotechnology & Sustainability (Spring 2023)
  - Focus on the role of biotechnology in agriculture and healthcare, with a focus on applying biotechnology techniques with sustainability in mind.
