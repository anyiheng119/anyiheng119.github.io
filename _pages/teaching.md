“Yiheng joined Wake Forest University as a fellow in July 2022 and has since proven invaluable to our students. He has provided outstanding support across various fields, including machine learning, supply chain, and marketing. Yiheng’s patient and knowledgeable approach was instrumental in helping us successfully complete our practicum project using the cohort analysis method. His hardworking nature and willingness to assist students with any problem related to job search or academics are genuinely commendable. I highly recommend Yiheng to anyone seeking a dedicated and knowledgeable colleague.”

“I just want to take a moment and register a big compliment about Yiheng as he’s fulfilling his role as our Fellow. He has already been a fabulous support this semester to me as I teach Data Management. He’s dependable, he’s fast, he’s kept a lot of student technical headaches off of my desk, and he always has a great attitude. I only wish we could clone him!”
