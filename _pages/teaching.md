## Teaching Philosophy (as a Teaching Fellow / Assistant)

I shape my role as a Teaching Fellow around two central goals.

My first goal is to ensure students can grasp and master the material presented by the professor. I recognize that students have varied learning styles, and I accommodate these differences by employing diverse instructional approaches. In addition to traditional techniques like Office Hours and Q&A Sessions, I facilitate hands-on learning through group working sessions, live-coding and debugging sessions, and tutorial workshops. My approach emphasizes problem-solving, aiming to equip students with the tools and guidance they need to precisely identify and independently tackle issues, rather than just providing answers and solutions.

The second goal is to serve as a reliable partner to teaching faculty to enhance the overall educational experience. I strive to understand the underlying purposes behind the professor's needs and tasks, ensuring alignment with their teaching objectives. This involves effective communication, collaborative planning, and proactively addressing changes to ensure that our efforts are synchronized and contribute positively to the students' learning outcomes.

My commitment to these practices is rooted in my aspiration to become an impactful business educator, driven by a strong work ethic, a genuine willingness to help, and a sense of fulfillment.

<!-- 
These goals reflect my dedication to fostering a productive and supportive educational experience for both students and faculty.
