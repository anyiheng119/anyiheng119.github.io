## Teaching Philosophy (as a Teaching Assistant)

I shape my role as a Teaching Assistant around two central goals.

My first goal is to ensure students can grasp and master the material presented by the professor. I recognize that students have varied learning styles, and I accommodate these differences by employing diverse instructional approaches. In addition to traditional techniques like Office Hours and Q&A Sessions, I leverage technology to facilitate hands-on learning. This includes group working sessions, live-coding and debugging sessions, and tutorial workshops. I adopt a problem-solving mindset, aiming to equip students with the tools and guidance they need to independently tackle and resolve similar issues, rather than simply providing solutions.

The second goal is to work seamlessly with teaching faculty to enhance the overall educational experience. I strive to understand the underlying purposes behind the professor's needs and tasks, ensuring alignment with their teaching objectives. This involves clarifying preferred communication methods with students and being consistently responsive and reliable. 

My commitment to these practices is rooted in my aspiration to become an impactful business educator, driven by a strong work ethic and a genuine willingness to assist. These goals reflect my dedication to fostering a productive and supportive educational experience for both students and faculty.

“I just want to take a moment and register a big compliment about Yiheng as he’s fulfilling his role as our Fellow. He has already been a fabulous support this semester to me as I teach Data Management. He’s dependable, he’s fast, he’s kept a lot of student technical headaches off of my desk, and he always has a great attitude. I only wish we could clone him!”
