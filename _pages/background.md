My grandfather emigrated from Mexico to the United States at the start of the [Bracero program](https://www.labor.ucla.edu/what-we-do/research-tools/the-bracero-program/). He worked in agricultural fields in and around El Centro, CA to provide for his family back in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico. After a few years of residing in the United States, he acquired citizenship for himself and his family. My mother went on to earn an A.S degree, and she opened a daycare center without knowing much English and being a single mother. 

My grandfather and mother taught me to reach for the stars, so as a child, I inevitability developed an interest in astronomy. My mother bought me a telescope, and boy was I thrilled! I would look up at the stars with a stargazer's book in hand wondering how far I could see. I was lucky to have such amazing, influential role models that instilled hard work, grit, and curiosity in me; I truly stand on the shoulders of giants.

During my undergraduate studies, I reflected on my target career path. I soon realized that I wanted to become a scientist, so I began taking courses in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. I considered pursuing chemistry further, but I enjoyed learning about the way things worked in living things. I set my sights on plant science, particularly due to my family's background in agriculture. My decision for pursuing plant science was reinforced during a research experience at the Boyce Thompson Institute.

I am the first in my family to pursue a PhD. I made this decision for multiple reasons: (i) to challenge myself, (ii) to make use of the opportunities that I have but were not available to my family, (iii) to serve as an example to young Latino/a minds wondering what they can achieve. These three reasons drive me each day to invest my best in everything that I do.
