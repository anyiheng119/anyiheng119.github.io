I earned my Master's degree in Quantitative Economics from <a href="https://www.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">UCLA</a>, where I also obtained a Graduate Certificate in Data Science. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate studies in Economics at <a href="https://english.njau.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Nanjing Agricultural University</a> in China.

My research interests center on Quantitative Marketing, AI and Machine Learning in Marketing.I am particularly interested in studying algorithms that drive large-scale automated decision-making, including decision-focused machine learning and causal machine learning. In my doctoral studies, I look forward to crafting research at the intersection of Marketing, Data Science, and Decision Science. Beyond my academic work, I enjoy traveling and exploring new places.

<!-- 
My grandfather’s journey to the United States began with the [Bracero program](https://www.labor.ucla.edu/what-we-do/research-tools/the-bracero-program/), which brought him from Mexico to work in the agricultural fields around El Centro, CA. His hard work and determination eventually led to citizenship for himself and his family. My mother, inspired by his example, overcame language barriers and the challenges of being a single mother to earn an A.S degree and open her own daycare center.

Their perseverance and ambition instilled in me a desire to reach for the stars. As a child, I was fascinated by astronomy and spent countless hours gazing at the night sky with my telescope and stargazer’s book. My family’s background in agriculture also influenced my decision to pursue plant science during my undergraduate studies. A research experience at the Boyce Thompson Institute further reinforced my passion for this field.

Now, as the first in my family to pursue a PhD, I am driven by a desire to challenge myself, make the most of the opportunities available to me, and serve as a role model for young Latinx minds. I am grateful for the giants on whose shoulders I stand and strive to honor their legacy through my hard work and dedication.
