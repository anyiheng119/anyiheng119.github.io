[Pauli lab](https://thepaulilab.com/). I specialize
in Drought Stress, Plant Phenomics, and Applied Machine Learning. I earned my B.S. in
Biology from [Pacific Lutheran University](https://www.plu.edu/).

My work has been [published](publications) in *Journal of Open Source Education*. My [research](research) explores the variation, temporal basis of stress-adaptive traits and using a broad variety of methods such as machine learning, computer vision, distributed computing, container technology, big data, and geospatial.

## Photography & Videography
I have an interest in photography, which often interesects my interest in plant science. On my free time, I fly my DJI Mavic Mini 2 over deserts, forests, and agricultural fields around the American Southwest.
