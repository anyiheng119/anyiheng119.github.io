Bienvenido/Welcome! My life experiences taught me that we grow the most during uncomfortable circumstances. I purposefully challenge myself by seeking projects that push me beyond my perceived limits. This approach has allowed me to develop diverse, transdisciplinary skills, and today, I consider myself a hybrid: part plant scientist, part data scientist.

I earned my B.S. in Biology from [Pacific Lutheran University](https://www.plu.edu/). My interest in plant science began in the forests of Washington state and strengthened during a summer internship in [Dr. Jim Giovannoni's lab](https://btiscience.org/jim-giovannoni/) at the [Boyce Thompson Institute](https://btiscience.org/). I am currently part of the [Pauli lab](https://thepaulilab.com/) in the [School of Plant Sciences](https://cals.arizona.edu/spls/home) at the [University *of* Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/), where I am responsible for processing, storing, and analyzing data from the [Field Scanalyzer](https://news.arizona.edu/story/world-s-largest-robotic-field-scanner-now-place). I specialize in drought stress, plant phenomics, scientific computing, and applied machine learning. My interest in data science began early in my graduate studies and strengthened during self-directed learning of computer programming and the development of phenomic data processing pipelines. The skills that I developed now enable me to ask questions that were previously intractable due to a lack of data or methods for extracting information from data.

My work has been [published](publications) in *Frontiers in Plant Science*, *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*, *The Plant Phenome Journal*, and *Journal of Open Source Education*. I have also been featured in the *Wall Street Journal* (see video below), [Seed World](https://seedworld.com/how-the-night-sky-helped-emmanuel-gonzalez-love-plant-breeding/), and [CyVerse News](https://cyverse.org/plants-robots-and-other-interesting-things). My [research](research) explores the variation and temporal basis of adaptive traits in crops ranging from lettuce, sorghum, and cotton using a broad variety of methods including linear mixed models, machine learning, computer vision, distributed computing, container technology, and geospatial analysis. I have [teaching](teaching) experience in cyberinfrastructure, computing technologies, applied machine learning, and biotechnology.

## Extension
I apply my scientific programming and image processing skills to generate [point clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_cloud) of agricultural and wild plants. These point clouds are generated using thousands of images captured with a [DJI Mavic Mini 2](https://www.dji.com/mini-2) drone and [Dronelink](https://www.dronelink.com/) flight mapping software. These images are multifunctional and can be used to develop new useful ecological tools, such as machine learning algorithms to track population density and distribution.
