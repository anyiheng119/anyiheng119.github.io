I am a Graduate Research Assistant in the [School of Plant Sciences](https://cals.arizona.edu/spls/home) at the [University *of* Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/). I am part of the [Pauli lab](https://thepaulilab.com/). We are responsible for collecting, storing, and processing data from the [Field Scanalyzer](https://news.arizona.edu/story/world-s-largest-robotic-field-scanner-now-place). I specialize in Drought Stress, Plant Phenomics, and Applied Machine Learning. Throughout my graduate studies, I, along with an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, engineers, and other plant scientists, have developed [PhytoOracle](https://phytooracle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html), a suite of modular, scalable phenomic data processing pipelines. I earned my B.S. in Biology from [Pacific Lutheran University](https://www.plu.edu/). My interest in plant science began in the forests of Washington state and strengthened during a summer internship in [Dr. Jim Giovannoni's lab](https://btiscience.org/jim-giovannoni/) at the [Boyce Thompson Institute](https://btiscience.org/).

My work has been [published](publications) in the *Journal of Open Source Education* and *The Plant Phenome Journal* as well as featured in the *Wall Street Journal* (see video below) and [CyVerse News](https://cyverse.org/plants-robots-and-other-interesting-things). My [research](research) explores the variation and temporal basis of stress-adaptive traits using a broad variety of methods including linear mixed models, machine learning, computer vision, distributed computing, container technology, big data, and geospatial analysis. I have [teaching](teaching) experience in cyberinfrastructure, computing technologies, data processing pipelines, and applied machine learning.

## Background
My grandfather emigrated from Mexico to the United States at the start of the [Bracero program](https://www.labor.ucla.edu/what-we-do/research-tools/the-bracero-program/). He worked in agricultural fields in and around El Centro, CA to provide for his family back home. After a few years of residing in the US, he was able to complete the immigration process to acquire citizenship for himself and his family. My mother earned an A.S degree and started a daycare center, without knowing much English. They taught me to reach for the stars, so as a child, I inevitability developed an interest in astronomy. My mother bought me a telescope, and boy was I thrilled! I would look up at the stars with a stargazer's book in hand wondering how far I could see. I was lucky to have such amazing, influential role models, and today, I truly stand on the shoulders of giants. Although I did not end up pursuing astronomy, I now use a different lens with the same amount of curiosity.

## Hobbies
I enjoy photography & videography, which intersects my passion for plant science. On my free time, I shoot a Sony Î±6000 and fly a DJI Mavic Mini 2 over deserts, forests, and agricultural fields around the American Southwest. I post my photography on social media to share nature's beautiful complexity!

I also use my scientific programming and image processing skills to generate point clouds of wild and agricultural plants for science and technology communication. Below are point clouds generated from images collected with a [Mavic Mini 2](https://www.dji.com/mini-2/specs).
