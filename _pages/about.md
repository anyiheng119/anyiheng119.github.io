Bienvenido/a! I grew up in El Centro, CA. As a child, I developed an interest in astronomy. My mother bought me a telescope, and I would gaze up at the stars with an astronomy handbook in hand. Although I did not pursue astronomy, I now use a different lens with the same curiosity. 
I am a Graduate Research Assistant in the [School of Plant Sciences](https://cals.arizona.edu/spls/home) at the
[University *of* Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/). I am part of the 
[Pauli lab](https://thepaulilab.com/), and we are responsible for and processing data from the [Field Scanalyzer](https://news.arizona.edu/story/world-s-largest-robotic-field-scanner-now-place). I specialize
in Drought Stress, Plant Phenomics, and Applied Machine Learning. Throughout my graduate studies, I, along with an interdisciplinary, have developed [PhytoOracle](https://phytooracle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html), a suite of modular, scalable phenomic data processing pipelines. I earned my B.S. in Biology from [Pacific Lutheran University](https://www.plu.edu/). My interest in plant science developed during a summer internship in [Dr. Jim Giovannoni's lab](https://btiscience.org/jim-giovannoni/) at the [Boyce Thompson Institute](https://btiscience.org/).

My work has been [published](publications) in the *Journal of Open Source Education* and featured in the *Wall Street Journal*. My [research](research) explores the variation and temporal basis of stress-adaptive traits using a broad variety of methods including linear mixed models, machine learning, computer vision, distributed computing, container technology, big data, and geospatial analysis. I have [teaching](teaching) experience in cyberinfrastructure, computing technologies, data processing pipelines, and applied machine learning.

I enjoy photography, which intersects with my passion for plant science. On my free time, I shoot a Sony Î±6000 and fly a DJI Mavic Mini 2 over deserts, forests, and agricultural fields around the American Southwest. I post my photography on social media to share nature's beautiful complexity!
