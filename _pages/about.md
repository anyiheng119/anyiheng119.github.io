Welcome! I am a Graduate Research Assistant in the
[School of Plant Sciences](https://cals.arizona.edu/spls/home) at the
[University *of* Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/). I am part of the 
[Pauli lab](https://thepaulilab.com/). I specialize
in Drought Stress, Plant Phenomics, and Applied Machine Learning. I earned my B.S. in
Biology from [Pacific Lutheran University](https://www.plu.edu/).

My work has been [published](publications) in the *Journal of Open Source Education*. My [research](research) explores the variation and temporal basis of stress-adaptive traits using a broad variety of methods including linear mixed models, machine learning, computer vision, distributed computing, container technology, big data, and geospatial analysis. I have [teaching](teaching) experience in cyberinfrastructure, computing technologies, data processing pipelines, and applied machine learning.

I enjoy photography, which intersects with my passion for plant science. On my free time, I shoot a Sony Î±6000 and/or fly a DJI Mavic Mini 2 over deserts, forests, and agricultural fields around the American Southwest. I post my photography on social media to share nature's beautiful complexity!
