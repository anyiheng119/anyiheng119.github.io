## Background
Bienvenido/a! I grew up in the small desert city of El Centro, CA. My grandfather emigrated from Mexico to the United States at a young age. He worked in agricultural fields until the age of 60, providing for his family back home. Shortly after moving to the United States, my mother earned an A.S degree and started a daycare center, without knowing much English. I was lucky to have such amazing, influential role models, and today, I truly stand on the shoulders of giants. My mother and grandfather always taught me to reach for the stars, so as a child, I inevitability developed an interest in astronomy. My mother saved up money and bought me a telescope, and boy was I thrilled. I would gaze up at the stars with a stargazer's handbook in hand wondering how far I could gaze. Although I did not end up pursuing astronomy, I now use a different lens with the same amount of curiosity.

## Career
I am a Graduate Research Assistant in the [School of Plant Sciences](https://cals.arizona.edu/spls/home) at the [University *of* Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/). I am part of the [Pauli lab](https://thepaulilab.com/), and we are responsible for maintaining and processing data from the [Field Scanalyzer](https://news.arizona.edu/story/world-s-largest-robotic-field-scanner-now-place). I specialize in Drought Stress, Plant Phenomics, and Applied Machine Learning. Throughout my graduate studies, I, along with an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, engineers, and other plant scientists, have developed [PhytoOracle](https://phytooracle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html), a suite of modular, scalable phenomic data processing pipelines. I earned my B.S. in Biology from [Pacific Lutheran University](https://www.plu.edu/). My interest in plant science began in the forests of Washington state and strengthened during a summer internship in [Dr. Jim Giovannoni's lab](https://btiscience.org/jim-giovannoni/) at the [Boyce Thompson Institute](https://btiscience.org/).

My work has been [published](publications) in the *Journal of Open Source Education* and featured in the *Wall Street Journal* (see video below) and [CyVerse News](https://cyverse.org/plants-robots-and-other-interesting-things). My [research](research) explores the variation and temporal basis of stress-adaptive traits using a broad variety of methods including linear mixed models, machine learning, computer vision, distributed computing, container technology, big data, and geospatial analysis. I have [teaching](teaching) experience in cyberinfrastructure, computing technologies, data processing pipelines, and applied machine learning.

## Hobbies
I enjoy photography, which intersects with my passion for plant science. On my free time, I shoot a Sony Î±6000 and fly a DJI Mavic Mini 2 over deserts, forests, and agricultural fields around the American Southwest. I post my photography on social media to share nature's beautiful complexity!
