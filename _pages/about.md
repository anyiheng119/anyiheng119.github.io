Bienvenido/Welcome! My life experiences taught me that we grow the most during uncomfortable circumstances. I purposefully challenge myself and seek projects that push me beyond my perceived limits. This approach has allowed me to develop diverse, transdisciplinary skills, and today, I consider myself a hybrid: part plant scientist, part data scientist.

I am currently part of the [Pauli lab](https://thepaulilab.com/) in the [School of Plant Sciences](https://cals.arizona.edu/spls/home) at the [University *of* Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/), where I am responsible for processing, storing, and analyzing data from the [Field Scanalyzer](https://news.arizona.edu/story/world-s-largest-robotic-field-scanner-now-place). I specialize in Drought Stress, Plant Phenomics, Scientific Computing, and Applied Machine Learning. Throughout my graduate studies, I, along with an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, engineers, and fellow plant scientists, developed [PhytoOracle](https://phytooracle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html), a suite of modular, scalable phenomic data processing pipelines. I earned my B.S. in Biology from [Pacific Lutheran University](https://www.plu.edu/). My interest in plant science began in the forests of Washington state and strengthened during a summer internship in [Dr. Jim Giovannoni's lab](https://btiscience.org/jim-giovannoni/) at the [Boyce Thompson Institute](https://btiscience.org/). My interest in data science began early in my graduate studies and strengthened during self-directed learning of programming and the development of phenomic data processing pipelines, which now enable me to ask questions that were previously intractable due to a lack of data or methods for extracting information from data.

My work has been [published](publications) in the *Journal of Open Source Education* and *The Plant Phenome Journal* as well as featured in the *Wall Street Journal* (see video below) and [CyVerse News](https://cyverse.org/plants-robots-and-other-interesting-things). My [research](research) explores the variation and temporal basis of stress-adaptive traits using a broad variety of methods including linear mixed models, machine learning, computer vision, distributed computing, container technology, big data, and geospatial analysis. I have [teaching](teaching) experience in cyberinfrastructure, computing technologies, data processing pipelines, and applied machine learning.

## Extension
I apply my scientific programming and image processing skills to generate [point clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_cloud) of agricultural and wild plants. These point clouds are generated using thousands of images captured with a [DJI Mavic Mini 2](https://www.dji.com/mini-2) drone and [Dronelink](https://www.dronelink.com/) flight mapping software. These images are multifunctional and can be used to develop new useful ecological tools, such as machine learning algorithms to track population density and distribution.

## Background
My grandfather emigrated from Mexico to the United States at the start of the [Bracero program](https://www.labor.ucla.edu/what-we-do/research-tools/the-bracero-program/). He worked in agricultural fields in and around El Centro, CA to provide for his family back in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico. After a few years of residing in the United States, he acquired citizenship for himself and his family. My mother went on to earn an A.S degree, and she opened a daycare center without knowing much English and while having to raise four children on her own. 

My grandfather and mother taught me to reach for the stars, so as a child, I inevitability developed an interest in astronomy. My mother bought me a telescope, and boy was I thrilled! I would look up at the stars with a stargazer's book in hand wondering how far I could see. I was lucky to have such amazing, influential role models that instilled hard work, grit, and curiosity in me; I truly stand on the shoulders of giants. Although I did not end up pursuing astronomy, I now use a different lens with the same amount of curiosity.
