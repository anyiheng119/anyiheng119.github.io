PhytoOracle is a series of modular, scalable phenomics data processing pipelines. Included in these pipelines is a 3D laser scanner processing pipeline which takes large point clouds and extracts individual plant point clouds. Ground truth height measurements were collected, hereby referred to as manually-extracted height. Manually-extracted and pipeline-extracted height measurements were compared to assess pipeline performance:

*Figure 1* Correlation between manually- and pipeline-extracted height measurements. The line-of-best fit was determined using the ordinary least-squares (OLS) method.
